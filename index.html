        <h1>Stonebreakers</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; position: center">
          I had a dream. Like there is ahead<br />
          And endless, empty and the wildest plane.<br />
          And I stand there, held by iron chain,<br />
          Under the tall rock made from finest granite<br />
          And next to me are thousands just like me.<br /><br />

          The face of everyone is marked by woe and sorrow,<br />
          And eyes of everyone contain fervor of love.<br />
          And hands of everyone are chained with snakes of iron,<br />
          And every shoulder's bent low to the ground,<br />
          Because a scary burden crushes all us down.<br /><br />

          And everyone holds heavy iron hammer,<br />
          And loud voice from above sounds like a raging thunder:<br />
          "Thou split this rock! Allow no cold, nor heat<br />
          To stop you! Suffer pain, and thirst, and hunger,<br />
          Because you are to break this rock apart!"<br /><br />

          And all, like one, upthrusted their hands,<br />
          And thousands hammers started working on the rock.<br />
          And thousand fragments flied in all directions,<br />
          We hit the cliff with force of desperation<br />
          Time after time still beating on that crag.<br /><br />

          Like growl of waterfall, like roar of bloody battle,<br />
          Again our hammers clattered and again<br />
          And inch by inch we conquered bigger space,<br />
          Though lots of us were crippled by those crags,<br />
          We carried on, and nothing could impede us.<br /><br />

          Knew everyone that we would get no glory,<br />
          We wouldn't be remembered in the end.<br />
          That only then would people walk this road,<br />
          When rock was battered, leveled everywhere,<br />
          And our bones stopped rotting underneath.<br /><br />

          We didn't want the glory for the doing,<br />
          We are no heroes looking for the fame.<br />
          No, we are servants, though at free will's guidance<br />
          We took these bonds. Became the slaves of choice,<br />
          At future's way we are just the stonebreakers.<br /><br />

          We all believed that we will break the rock<br />
          With our hands, we'll shatter the granite.<br />
          With our broken bones and our blood<br />
          We'll lay a firm foundation, and right after<br />
          New life, new hope will come into this world.<br /><br />

          And we all knew that far in world of ours,<br />
          Which we abandoned for the labor, sweat and bonds,<br />
          Hot tears were cried by wives, and sons, and mothers.<br />
          That wrathful and irate, our enemies and rivals,<br />
          Curse us, and our purpose, our cause.<br /><br />

          We knew it, and that thought was often painful,<br />
          The sorrow stroke, and heart was torn apart.<br />
          But neither tears, nor grief, nor burning pain<br />
          Not even curses stalled us from the work,<br />
          And never someone let his hammer out.<br /><br />

          So there we went, united all as one<br />
          By sacred dream, with hammers in our hands.<br />
          Let us be cursed and totally forsaken!<br />
          We break this rock, we make the path for truth,<br />
          And happiness for all will walk on our bones.<br />
